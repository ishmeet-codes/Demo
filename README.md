By definition, this is also the Maclaurin series for cos $x$. In Section 8.10, we will see that the series converges to cos $x$ at every $x$.

Because $f^{(2n+1)}(0) = 0$, the Taylor polynomials of orders $2n$ and $2n+1$ are identical:

$$ P_{2n}(x) = P_{2n+1}(x) = 1 - \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} - \cdots + (-1)^n \frac{x^{2n}}{(2n)!} $$

Figure 1.18 shows how well these polynomials approximate $f(x) = \cos(x)$ near $x = 0$. Only the right-hand portions of the graphs are given because the graphs are symmetric about the y-axis.

**EXAMPLE 4**: A function $f$ whose Taylor series converges at every $x$ but converges to only  $f(x)$ at $x = 0$

It can be shown (though not easily) that

$$ f(x) = \begin{cases} 
0, & x = 0 \\ 
e^{-1/x^2}, & x \neq 0 
\end{cases} $$

(Fig. 1.19) has derivatives of all orders at $x = 0$ and that $f^{(n)}(0) = 0$ for all $n$. This means that the Taylor series generated by $f$ at $x = 0$ is

$$
f(0) + f'(0)x + \frac{f''(0)}{2!}x^2 + \cdots + \frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}x^n + \cdots 
$$

 $$
 = 0 + 0 \cdot x + 0 \cdot x^2 + \cdots + 0 \cdot x^n + \cdots 
 $$

 $$
 = 0 + 0 + \cdots + 0 + \cdots
 $$

The series converges for every $x$ (its sum is 0) but converges to $f(x)$ only at $x = 0$.

Two questions still remain.

1. For what values of $x$ can we normally expect a Taylor series to converge to its generating function?

2. How accurately do a function's Taylor polynomials approximate the function on a given interval?

The answers are provided by a theorem of Taylor in the next section.
