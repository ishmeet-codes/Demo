By definition, this is also the Maclaurin series for cos $x$. In Section 1.10, we will see that the series converges to cos $x$ at every $x$.

Because $f^{(2n+1)}(0) = 0$, the Taylor polynomials of orders $2n$ and $2n+1$ are identical:

$$ P_{2n}(x) = P_{2n+1}(x) = 1 - \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} - \cdots + (-1)^n \frac{x^{2n}}{(2n)!} $$

Figure 1.18 shows how well these polynomials approximate $f(x) = \cos(x)$ near $x = 0$. Only the right-hand portions of the graphs are given because the graphs are symmetric about the y-axis.

**EXAMPLE 4**: A function $f$ whose Taylor series converges at every $x$ but converges to only  $f(x)$ at $x = 0$

It can be shown (though not easily) that

$$ f(x) = \begin{cases} 
0, & x = 0 \\ 
e^{-1/x^2}, & x \neq 0 
\end{cases} $$

(Fig. 1.19) has derivatives of all orders at $x = 0$ and that $f^{(n)}(0) = 0$ for all $n$. This means that the Taylor series generated by $f$ at $x = 0$ is

$$
f(0) + f'(0)x + \frac{f''(0)}{2!}x^2 + \cdots + \frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}x^n + \cdots 
$$

 $$
 = 0 + 0 \cdot x + 0 \cdot x^2 + \cdots + 0 \cdot x^n + \cdots 
 $$

 $$
 = 0 + 0 + \cdots + 0 + \cdots
 $$

The series converges for every $x$ (its sum is 0) but converges to $f(x)$ only at $x = 0$.

Two questions still remain.

1. For what values of $x$ can we normally expect a Taylor series to converge to its generating function?

2. How accurately do a function's Taylor polynomials approximate the function on a given interval?

The answers are provided by a theorem of Taylor in the next section.

29. Use the Taylor series generated by $e^x$ at $x = a$ to show that 
$e^x = e^a \left[ 1 + (x - a) + \frac{(x - a)^2}{2!} + \ldots \right]$

30. (Continuation of Exercise 29.) Find the Taylor series generated by $e^x$ at $x = 1$. Compare your answer with the formula in Exercise 29.

31. Let $f(x)$ have derivatives through order $n$ at $x = a$. Show that the Taylor polynomial of order $n$ and its first $n$ derivatives have the same values that $f$and its first $n$ derivatives have at $x = a$.


32. Of all polynomials of degree ≤ n, the Taylor polynomial of order n gives the best approximation. Suppose that $f(x)$ is differentiable on an interval centered at $x = a$ and that $g(x) = b_0 + b_1(x-a) + \cdots + b_n(x-a)^n$ is a polynomial of degree n with constant coefficients $b_0, \cdots, b_n$. Let $E(x) = f(x) - g(x)$. Show that if we impose on $g$ the conditions

a) $E(a) = 0$     The approximation error is zero at $x = a$.

b) $\lim_{{x \to a}} \frac{E(x)}{(x-a)^n} = 0$  The error is negligible when compared to $(x-a)^n$.

then
$$ g(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a) + \frac{f''(a)}{2!}(x-a)^2 + \cdots + \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x-a)^n. $$

Thus, the Taylor polynomial $P_n(x)$ is the only polynomial of degree less than or equal to n whose error is both zero at $x = a$ and negligible when compared with $(x-a)^n$.

The Taylor polynomial of order 2 generated by a twice-differentiable function $f(x)$ at $x = a$ is called the quadratic approximation of $f$ at $x = a$. In Exercises 33-38, find the (a) linearization (Taylor polynomial of order 1) and (b) quadratic approximation of $f$ at $x = 0$.

## Convergence of Taylor Series; Error Estimates

This section addresses the two questions left unanswered by Section 8.9:

1. When does a Taylor series converge to its generating function?
2. How accurately do a function’s Taylor polynomials approximate the function on a given interval?

### Taylor’s Theorem

We answer these questions with the following theorem.

#### Theorem 16
**Taylor’s Theorem**

If $f$ and its first $n$ derivatives $f', f'', \ldots, f^{(n)}$ are continuous on $[a, b]$ or on $[b, a]$, and $f^{(n)}$ is differentiable on $(a, b)$ or on $(b, a)$, then there exists a number $c$ between $a$ and $b$ such that
$f(b) = f(a) + f'(a)(b - a) + \frac{f''(a)}{2!}(b - a)^2 + \cdots + \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(b - a)^n + \frac{f^{(n+1)}(c)}{(n+1)!}(b - a)^{n+1}.$

Taylor's theorem is a generalization of the Mean Value Theorem (Exercise 39). There is a proof of Taylor’s theorem at the end of this section.

When we apply Taylor’s theorem, we usually want to hold a fixed and treat $b$ as an independent variable. Taylor’s formula is easier to use in circumstances like these if we change $b$ to $x$. Here is how the theorem reads with this change.


# Corollary to Taylor's Theorem

## Taylor's Formula
If $f$ has derivatives of all orders in an open interval $I$ containing $a$, then for each positive integer $n$ and for each $x$ in $I$,

$$
f(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x - a) + \frac{f''(a)}{2!}(x - a)^2 + \cdots + \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x - a)^n + R_n(x),
$$

where

$$ 
R_n(x) = \frac{f^{(n+1)}(c)}{(n + 1)!}(x - a)^{n+1} 
$$

for some $c$ between $x$ and $a$.

When we state Taylor's theorem this way, it says that for each $x$ in $I$,

$$ 
f(x) = P_n(x) + R_n(x). 
$$

Pause for a moment to think about how remarkable this equation is. For any value of $$n$$ we want, the equation gives both a polynomial approximation of $$f$$ of that order and a formula for the error involved in using that approximation over the interval $I$.

Equation (1) is called **Taylor's formula**. The function $R_n(x)$ is called the remainder of order $n$ or the error term for the approximation of $f$ by $P_n(x)$ over $I$. If $R_n(x) \to 0$ as $n \to \infty$ for all $x$ in $I$, we say that the Taylor series generated by $f$ at $x = a$ converges to $f$ on $I$, and we write

$$ 
f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{(k)}(a)}{k!}(x - a)^k. 
$$

#### Example 1: The Maclaurin Series for $e^x$

Show that the Taylor series generated by $f(x) = e^x$ at $x = 0$ converges to $f(x)$ for every real value of $x$.

**Solution:**
The function has derivatives of all orders throughout the interval $I = (-\infty, \infty)$. Equations (1) and (2) with $f(x) = e^x$ and $a = 0$ give

$$ 
e^x = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \cdots + \frac{x^n}{n!} + R_n(x), 
$$

and

$$ 
R_n(x) = \frac{e^c x^{n+1}}{(n + 1)!} 
$$   

for some $c$ between 0 and $x$.

Since $e^x$ is an increasing function of $x$, $e^c$ lies between $e^0 = 1$ and $e^x$. When $x$ is negative, so is $c$, and $e^c < 1$. When $x$ is zero, $c = 0$ and $R_n(x) = 0$. When $x$ is positive, so is $c$, and $e^c < e^x$. Thus,

$$ 
|R_n(x)| \leq \frac{|x|^{n+1}}{(n + 1)!}
$$  

where $x \leq 0$.


and

$$ 
|R_n(x)| < e^x \frac{x^{n+1}}{(n + 1)!} \quad \text{when } x > 0. 
$$

Finally, because

$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{x^{n+1}}{(n + 1)!} = 0 \quad \text{for every } x,
$$

$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} R_n(x) = 0,
$$

and the series converges to $e^x$ for every $x$.

$$
e^x = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^k}{k!} = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \cdots + \frac{x^k}{k!} + \cdots.
$$
